# BrochureGen-AI
Short Description for GitHub Repository: An AI-powered tool that automates the generation of hyper-personalized, engaging digital brochures for Airbnb listings using Large Language Models (LLMs) and web scraping, with multi-language support.



# BrochureGen-AI: AI-Powered Airbnb Brochure Generator

## Project Overview

`BrochureGen-AI` is an intelligent tool designed to revolutionize how Airbnb hosts market their properties. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and web scraping, this application automates the creation of professional, engaging, and hyper-personalized digital brochures for any Airbnb listing.

From dynamically crafting property descriptions and amenity highlights to suggesting local attractions tailored to specific guest personas, `BrochureGen-AI` ensures your marketing materials resonate directly with your ideal audience, saving hosts valuable time and enhancing their promotional efforts.

## Key Features

* **Intelligent Content Generation:** Automatically writes compelling property descriptions, amenity highlights, welcome messages, FAQs, and calls-to-action based on scraped webpage content.
* **AI-Driven Personalization & Audience Targeting:** Dynamically tailors brochure language, emphasizes specific amenities, and curates local recommendations to appeal to defined guest personas (e.g., "families," "business travelers," "adventure seekers").
* **Multilingual Support:** (Implied from initial prompt - "put it out in different languages") Generates brochures in various languages, expanding reach.
* **Web Scraping Integration:** Gathers initial property information and relevant company/service links directly from specified URLs.
* **Flexible Output:** Produces brochure content in markdown format, easily convertible to digital brochures or print-ready layouts.
* **Iterative Refinement:** Designed to allow user feedback for refining generated content.

## How It Works (High-Level)

1.  **URL Input:** The user provides the main URL of an Airbnb company's website (or a specific property listing page).
2.  **Web Scraping (`Website` class):** The tool scrapes the main landing page for general company information (title, content) and extracts all internal and external links.
3.  **Relevant Link Filtering (LLM):** An LLM (e.g., GPT-4o-mini) analyzes the extracted links, identifies relevant company pages (e.g., "About," "Services," "Help"), and returns them in a structured JSON format.
4.  **Content Aggregation:** The tool then scrapes the content from these identified relevant links, compiling all the pertinent text.
5.  **Brochure Generation (LLM):** The aggregated content, along with the user's specific instructions (e.g., desired tone, target guest persona), is fed into the LLM. The LLM then generates the full brochure content in markdown, adhering to a defined structure and personalization criteria.
6.  **Display:** The generated markdown brochure is displayed, ready for review or further design integration.

## Setup Instructions

To run this project locally or in a Colab environment, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/BrochureGen-AI.git](https://github.com/your-username/BrochureGen-AI.git)
    cd BrochureGen-AI
    ```
2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file containing `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `python-dotenv`, `openai`, `ipython` (if using notebooks), `markdown`.)

3.  **Set up OpenAI API Key:**
    * Obtain an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
    * Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory.
    * Add your API key to the `.env` file:
        ```
        OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-proj-YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE'
        ```

4.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Untitled.ipynb
    ```

## Usage

Open the `Untitled.ipynb` notebook and execute the cells sequentially.

Key functions to look for:

* `Website(url)`: To scrape webpage content and links.
* `get_links(url)`: Uses an LLM to identify relevant links from a webpage.
* `get_brochure_user_prompt(company_name, url)`: Aggregates scraped content into a prompt for brochure generation.
* `create_brochure(company_name, url)`: The main function to generate and display the brochure.
