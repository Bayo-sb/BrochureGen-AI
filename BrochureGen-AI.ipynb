We now boast over **5 million hosts** who’ve welcomed more than **2 billion guests** across **220 countries**. Yes, you heard that right -**BILLIONS**!\n",

       "- **Experiences Like No Other:** Go beyond the ordinary! Tap into ‘Experiences’ for local treasures such as llama yoga in the park or a cooking class with someone’s grandma (cooking skills not guaranteed).\n",
